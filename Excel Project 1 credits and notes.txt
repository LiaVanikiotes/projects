Thanks to Alextheanalyst for the excel project video. 

This is my very first Excel project. For the data cleaning part and the third table in the dashboard "commute distance and bike purchase" alex's video was of great help.
 
Moving on, after cleaning the data I did some basic EDA analysis, using conditional formatting, in order to formulate hypotheses that I could then visualize in order to explore more. 
In the EDA sheet I went ahead and created a new column named "Income groupings". There using nested "if" formulas I organized the income based on certain ranges,
so that it is easier to interpret. The ranges for the classification of the income was retrieved from this website:

The insights gained from the dashboard could be used in a hypothetical senario for developing a strategic marketing framework. 
It can be used to guide the planning process especially the segmentation part of it. Through the Geographic and Demographic information given by the dashboard, 
an effective segmentanion plan can take place, accordingly, followed by the profiling stage. For example, one way that profiling can be done, based on the data analysis, is by revenue.
Next and final step is the development of an effective strategy. Based on the insights from the dashboard that may include targeted ads or different pricing and discounts according to 
the region, marital status etc. 

In conclusion this data analysis can be used in this hypothetical scenario in order for SMART goals to be set.
